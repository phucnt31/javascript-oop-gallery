## Introduction

- The Gallery project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by creating a gallery with previous and next buttons, as well as the ability for users to click on an image to navigate to the desired image. It utilizes classes and objects to model the gallery functionality, allowing users to browse through a collection of images.
